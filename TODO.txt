Baseline framework preparation:

Finetune avalanche
Joint training avalanche
LwF mammoth
EWC mammoth
Gdumb mammoth
DER++ mammoth
ProgressNet avalanche

==========================

Avalanche 0.2.1 (for fine tune, joint training, progressnet)
pip install avalanche-lib==0.2.1

Mammoth (for LwF, EWC, Gdumb, DER++)
https://github.com/aimagelab/mammoth

Python environment as in packages.txt

==========================

joint_avalanche.sh already contains 5 calling to run CUB 5 times. still need to create/adjust the pickle location.
joint_avalanche.py also needs to be adjusted where you put cifar100 and cub dataset. the same with fine tune and progressnet.
I can't make pure shell/bash scripting so I just call python 5 times.
from joint training pickle output:
    1. take the dictionary from the only element in the list
        - FAA: Top1_Acc_Stream/eval_phase/test_stream/Task000 
        - FF: no forgetting for joint training

ftune_avalanche.sh contains 1 10 tasks CUB and 1 20 tasks CUB.
I run all experiments 5 times each to get the average. so, they're similar to joint_avalanche.sh.
from fine tuning pickle output:
    1. take the dictionary from the last element in the list
        - FAA: Top1_Acc_Stream/eval_phase/test_stream/Task000
        - FF: StreamForgetting/eval_phase/test_stream

pnn_avalanche.sh contains 1 10 tasks CUB and 1 20 tasks CUB.
I run all experiments 5 times each to get the average. so, they're similar to joint_avalanche.sh.
from pnn pickle output:
    1. take the dictionary from the last element in the list
        - FAA: Top1_Acc_Stream/eval_phase/test_stream/Task000
        - FF: StreamForgetting/eval_phase/test_stream

==========================
To run this, copy the content of the following python scripts and paste/replace in the old directory.

Mammoth:
backbone/SimpleMLP.py
datasets/base.py
datasets/mod_cifar100.py
datasets/mod_cub.py
models/derpp_mod.py
models/ewc_mod.py
models/gdumb_mod.py
models/lwf_mod.py
utils/args.py
utils/conf.py
utils/main.py
utils/training_mod.py

for mammoth, the shell scripts should be put inside the "utils/" directory.

lwf_mammoth.sh contains 5 10 tasks CUB and 5 20 tasks CUB.
the output path in the shell script still needs to be adjusted.
from the text file output:
    - FAA: Final_acc
    - FF: Forgetting

ewc_mammoth.sh contains 1 10 tasks CUB and 1 20 tasks CUB.
need to add 4 more each to get 5 for average.
like lwf, the output path still needs to be adjusted.
from the text file output:
    - FAA: Final_acc
    - FF: Forgetting

gdumb_mammoth.sh contains 1 10 tasks CUB (1000 and 2000 buffer) and 1 20 tasks CUB (1000 and 2000 buffer).
in total, there will be 20 outputs.
like lwf, the output path still needs to be adjusted.
from the text file output:
    - FAA: Final_acc
    - FF: no forgetting as Gdumb behaves differently

derpp_mammoth.sh contains 1 10 tasks CUB (1000 and 2000 buffer) and 1 20 tasks CUB (1000 and 2000 buffer).
like gdumb, in total, there will be 20 outputs.
like lwf, the output path still needs to be adjusted.
from the text file output:
    - FAA: Final_acc
    - FF: Forgetting
